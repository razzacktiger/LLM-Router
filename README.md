## Hybrid Model Selection API

- **Endpoint**: `/api/hybrid-select`
- **Logic**: Combines Gemini AI analysis with deterministic scoring
- **Leaderboard Context**: All 35+ models are considered, grouped by performance tier and specialty
- **Prompt Engineering**: Gemini receives full leaderboard context and recommends models for the task, not just top performers
- **Selection Output**: Returns selected model, score breakdown, AI reasoning, and alternatives

## How It Works

1. **Prompt & Priorities**: User enters a prompt and ranks priorities (performance, cost, speed)
2. **Leaderboard Data**: All available models and benchmarks are fetched
3. **Gemini Analysis**: AI analyzes the prompt and leaderboard, classifies the task, and recommends models
4. **Deterministic Scoring**: Mathematical scoring ranks all models by weighted priorities
5. **Final Recommendation**: The best model is selected, with reasoning and alternatives provided
## üöÄ LLM Router & Model Analysis Platform

Welcome to the future of LLM model selection! This project is your all-in-one playground for exploring, benchmarking, and intelligently choosing the best language models for any task. Powered by Next.js, Google Gemini, and a live leaderboard of 35+ models, you'll get recommendations that are smart, fast, and tailored to your needs.

Ready to supercharge your AI workflow? Dive in and let the Router do the heavy lifting!

This project is a Next.js application for intelligent LLM model selection, benchmarking, and analysis. It features a hybrid model selection API powered by Google Gemini and deterministic scoring, leveraging a live leaderboard of 35+ models for accurate recommendations.
