Based on the user's prompt and stated priorities, recommend the optimal model from the available options using comprehensive leaderboard data and performance metrics.

    ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
    1. TASK ANALYSIS: Parse the user's prompt to identify:
       - Task type (reasoning, creative writing, coding, analysis, etc.)
       - Complexity level (simple, moderate, complex, expert-level)
       - Output requirements (length, format, style, accuracy needs)
       - Specific constraints (latency, cost, quality thresholds)

    2. PRIORITY WEIGHTING: Evaluate each model against the user's priority ranking:
       - Calculate weighted scores based on priority importance
       - Consider how well each model aligns with top priorities
       - Identify potential conflicts between competing priorities

    3. MODEL ASSESSMENT: Consider task-specific model strengths:
       - Domain expertise and specialization areas
       - Known performance patterns for similar tasks
       - Reliability and consistency metrics
       - Current leaderboard standings for relevant benchmarks

    4. TRADE-OFF EVALUATION: Balance competing factors:
       - Performance vs cost efficiency
       - Speed vs quality
       - Specialized capabilities vs general performance
       - Risk tolerance based on task criticality

    Based on this comprehensive analysis, provide your recommendation as the exact model name only (no additional text or explanation).`;
